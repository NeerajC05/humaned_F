	<p style=" padding-top: 10px; text-align: center;">Still confused if HumanEd is for you? Continue reading our FAQ to help you decide</p>
	
	<h4 style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">Who are HumanED and what do we do?</h4>
	<p>We are a society with the primary aim of building a Humanoid Robot. Since building a humanoid robot is a very complex task and cannot be completed quickly, we came up with an efficient and goal based system. Each year we work on a couple of smaller projects which we assemble and integrate in the long run to make a fully functioning humanoid robot. In the academic year 2021 - 2022 we have been working on a biomimetic hand and an exoskeleton system. </p>

	<h4 style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">What are you upcoming projects and workshops?</h4>
	<p>Projects - Biped Robot Simulation, and the implementation of the Biomimetic Hand</p>
	<p>Workshops - CAD (Fusion360), Electronics, Simulation (Webot), and Programming (C++, Python, Git, OpenCV, and ROS)</p>

	<h4 style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">Want to join us but your interests aren’t listed?</h4>
	<p>Don’t worry if your interests are not listed here, just reach out to us and we will see where you fit best in the society! It doesn’t necessarily have to do with technical aspects. There are other teams such as marketing, sponsorship, content creation and video shooting! </p>

	<h4 style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">Do I need to be a science student?</h4>
	<p>No, you just need to be a student at the University of Edinburgh and be interested in robotics. Regardless of what degree you are taking or if you don’t know where to start with a humanoid robot, you are in the right place.</p>

	<h4 style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">How many hours of work commitment is required?</h4>
	<p>There is no fixed time you need to devote to the society. Your level of involvement completely depends on how much time you are willing to spare!</p>

	<h4 style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;">How do I join the society?</h4>
	<p>All you need to do is fill in a form to give us basic information about yourself and we will get back to you! In the form you can tell us what joining motives and preferences are. It will only take 2-3 minutes to fill in the form!</p>
